# Time Remaining Feature Removed from Quiz Interface

## Changes Made

### File: `src/components/quiz/QuizInterface.tsx`

#### Removed:
1. ✅ **Imports**: Removed `useEffect` hook and `Clock` icon
2. ✅ **State**: Removed `timeRemaining` state variable
3. ✅ **Timer Effect**: Removed `useEffect` that counted down every second
4. ✅ **Auto-submit**: Removed automatic quiz submission when time runs out
5. ✅ **Format Function**: Removed `formatTime()` helper function
6. ✅ **UI Element**: Removed the time remaining display from header (Clock icon + countdown timer)

#### What Remains:
- Progress bar showing question completion percentage
- Question counter (e.g., "Question 3 of 10")
- All quiz functionality (answering questions, navigation, submission)

## Result

The quiz interface no longer shows or tracks time. Students can now:
- Take as much time as they need to answer questions
- Not worry about a countdown timer
- Not have the quiz auto-submit when time expires

## Backend Note

The backend still has `timeLimit` fields in:
- Quiz model (`backend/src/models/Quiz.ts`)
- Quiz routes (`backend/src/routes/quiz.routes.ts`)
- Type definitions (`backend/src/types/index.ts`)

These are harmless and don't affect the frontend. They can be left as-is or removed later if desired. The quiz will simply ignore the timeLimit value.

## Testing

1. Start a quiz from the interface
2. Verify no timer/clock appears in the header
3. Confirm you can take unlimited time to complete the quiz
4. Quiz should only submit when you click the "Submit" button
