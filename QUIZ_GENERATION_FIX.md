# Quiz Generation Fix

## Problem
Quiz generation was failing with the error:
- "Error parsing contextual quiz: Failed to parse quiz from AI response"
- Empty or blocked responses from the AI model

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Insufficient Token Limit**: The model was configured with only 2048 max output tokens, which wasn't enough for generating 10 detailed quiz questions
2. **Content Filtering**: Safety settings might have been blocking educational content
3. **Unclear Prompt**: The prompt didn't provide clear examples for all question types (multiple-choice, numerical, text)
4. **Poor Error Logging**: Insufficient logging made it hard to debug what the AI was actually returning

## Changes Made

### 1. ai.service.ts - Model Configuration
- ✅ Increased `maxOutputTokens` from 2048 to **8192**
- ✅ Added safety settings with `BLOCK_NONE` threshold to prevent false positives on educational content
- ✅ Imported `HarmCategory` and `HarmBlockThreshold` from the Gemini SDK

### 2. ai.service.ts - generateQuiz Method
- ✅ Added detailed logging for prompt creation
- ✅ Added check for blocked content from AI API
- ✅ Added response length logging
- ✅ Added response preview logging
- ✅ Added check for empty responses
- ✅ Improved error logging with more context

### 3. ai.service.ts - buildContextualQuizPrompt Method
- ✅ Completely redesigned the prompt to be clearer and more concise
- ✅ Added concrete examples for all question types:
  - Multiple-choice with options array
  - Numerical with acceptableRange
  - Text with keywords array
- ✅ Simplified instructions to reduce confusion
- ✅ Added "Start your response with { now:" at the end to prompt immediate JSON output

### 4. ai.service.ts - parseContextualQuiz Method
- ✅ Enhanced error logging to show full response text and length
- ✅ Better debugging information for troubleshooting

## Testing Instructions

1. **Restart the backend server** to apply the changes:
   ```powershell
   # In the backend directory
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Try generating a quiz** from the frontend:
   - Have a conversation with the AI tutor about a topic
   - Click "Generate Quiz" 
   - Select difficulty (e.g., "hard") and question types
   - Check the backend terminal for detailed logs

3. **Expected logs** (if successful):
   ```
   info: Quiz generation prompt created
   info: AI response received, length: XXXX characters
   info: AI response preview: {...
   info: Successfully parsed quiz with X questions
   ```

4. **If it still fails**, check the logs for:
   - `Content was blocked:` - indicates safety filtering issue
   - `Empty response from AI model` - indicates API issue
   - `rawTextFull:` - will show exactly what the AI returned

## Additional Notes

- The quiz is now limited to a maximum of 10 questions (was 5 before)
- The prompt explicitly asks for a mix of question types as requested
- All safety filters are disabled to allow educational content (sorting algorithms, DSA, etc.)
- The model will now have enough tokens to generate detailed explanations for each question

## Rollback

If these changes cause issues, you can:
1. Revert `maxOutputTokens` back to 2048
2. Remove the `safetySettings` configuration
3. Restore the original prompt format
