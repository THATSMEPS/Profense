# Dashboard Statistics - Quick Test Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All dashboard statistics now display **real data from the database**:

### What Was Fixed:
1. ✅ **Courses Completed** - Now counts courses with all topics covered
2. ✅ **Hours Learned** - Calculated from actual chat session durations
3. ✅ **Quiz Score Average** - Real average from completed quiz attempts
4. ✅ **Current Streak** - User's consecutive login days

### How to Test:

#### 1. Test Quiz Statistics
```bash
# Action: Complete a quiz with 80% score
# Expected: Dashboard shows "Quiz Score Avg: 80%"
# Expected: Dashboard shows "Quizzes Taken: 1"
```

#### 2. Test Learning Time
```bash
# Action: Have a 10-minute chat session
# Expected: Dashboard shows "Hours Learned" > 0
# Note: Time is estimated from message timestamps
```

#### 3. Test Course Progress
```bash
# Action: Enroll in a course and chat about its topics
# Expected: Course card shows progress > 0%
# Expected: "Continue Learning" section shows the course
```

#### 4. Test Streak Days
```bash
# Action: Login on consecutive days
# Expected: "Current Streak" increments (1 day, 2 days, etc.)
# Note: Starts at 0 for new users
```

### API Endpoints to Test:

```bash
# Get user stats
GET /api/users/stats
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>

# Expected Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalStudyTime": 120,        // minutes
    "streakDays": 3,
    "coursesCompleted": 1,
    "quizzesTaken": 5,
    "averageScore": 85,
    "weeklyProgress": {
      "thisWeek": 4,
      "lastWeek": 2,
      "change": 100
    },
    "enrolledCourses": 3,
    ...
  }
}
```

```bash
# Get enrolled courses with progress
GET /api/courses/enrolled
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>

# Expected Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "courses": [
      {
        ...courseData,
        "progress": 60,              // 0-100%
        "completedTopics": 3,
        "totalTopics": 5,
        "timeSpent": 45,             // minutes
        "lastAccessed": "2025-10-26T..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Verification Steps:

1. **Start Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Login to Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to `/dashboard`
   - Check that stats show real numbers (not all zeros)

4. **Take Actions**:
   - Complete a quiz → Check "Quiz Score Avg"
   - Chat for 5 minutes → Check "Hours Learned"
   - Cover course topics → Check course progress cards
   - Login daily → Check "Current Streak"

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: All stats show zero
- **Cause**: New user with no activity
- **Solution**: Complete at least one quiz or chat session

**Issue**: Hours learned not increasing
- **Cause**: Chat sessions too short (< 1 minute)
- **Solution**: Have longer conversations (5+ messages)

**Issue**: Course progress stuck at 0%
- **Cause**: Chat topic doesn't match course topics
- **Solution**: Ensure chat session `subject` matches course subject

### Data Sources:

| Dashboard Stat | Database Source | Calculation |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Courses Completed | Course + ChatSession | Topics covered = total topics |
| Hours Learned | ChatSession + User | Message timestamp differences |
| Quiz Score Avg | Quiz.attempts | Sum(scores) / completed quizzes |
| Current Streak | User.streakDays | Consecutive daily logins |
| Course Progress | ChatSession | Topics mentioned / total topics |

### Next Steps:

1. **Test all 4 dashboard stats** by taking real actions
2. **Verify enrolled courses** show progress percentages
3. **Check recent courses section** displays actual enrolled courses
4. **Confirm subject breakdown** shows real session counts
