# Quick Summary: Discovery Phase Solution

## The Problem You Reported

**Issue**: When you go to Learn section and ask first question, moderation blocks it

**Root Cause**: 
- Learn section starts with no topic (`currentTopic = null`)
- User asks first question → System sets a vague topic
- Next question → Moderation thinks you're off-topic
- Result: Blocked even though you're just exploring

## The Solution: 3-Message Discovery Window

## What Changed

### Before
```
User enters Learn → No topic set
User: "What is quantum physics?"
System: Sets topic = "general learning" (vague)
User: "Tell me more about it"
System: ❌ BLOCKED - "it" doesn't match "general learning"
```

### After
```
User enters Learn → No topic set
User: "What is quantum physics?"
System: Discovery phase (1/3) → No moderation ✅
System: Learns topic = "quantum physics"
User: "Tell me more about it"
System: Discovery phase (2/3) → No moderation ✅
User: "How does this work?"
System: Discovery phase (3/3) → No moderation ✅
User: "Give me formulas"
System: Focus phase (4+) → Context-aware moderation
        Checks context → "quantum physics" mentioned ✅
        Result: ALLOWED ✅
```

## Code Changes

1. **Added message counter** to track discovery phase
2. **Skip moderation** for first 3 messages
3. **Enable moderation** from message 4 onwards
4. **Combined with context-awareness** for smart blocking

## Benefits

✅ **No early blocking** - First 3 messages always work  
✅ **Natural exploration** - Users can discover topics freely  
✅ **Smart focus** - Moderation kicks in after topic is clear  
✅ **Context retained** - "it", "this", "that" still understood  

## Testing It

Try this sequence:
1. Go to Learn section (blank, no topic)
2. Ask: "What is quantum physics?" → Should work ✅
3. Ask: "Tell me about wave functions" → Should work ✅
4. Ask: "Explain quantum tunneling" → Should work ✅
5. Ask: "Give me formulas for it" → Should work ✅ (context-aware)
6. Ask: "What about biology?" → Should block ❌ (off-topic)

## Future Enhancement

See `ADAPTIVE_TOPIC_LEARNING.md` for full system that:
- Auto-detects topics from first message
- Matches to existing courses
- Classifies into subjects
- Links progress automatically
